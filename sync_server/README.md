Sync Server Stub
----------------
This directory contains a minimal sync endpoint example to receive pushes from the desktop client.

Endpoints:
- POST /api/sync/push   - receive JSON payload of claims to sync
- GET  /api/sync/pull   - send reference tables/updates

This is a stub. Integrate with your central server database as needed.
